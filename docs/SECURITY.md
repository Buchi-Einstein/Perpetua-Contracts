# Security, Audit Scope and Bug Bounty (§101)

Preparing Perpetua for mainnet means being explicit about what has been
reviewed, who may review the rest, and what a reviewer is rewarded for finding.

This document is the scope **of record**. It answers:

1. what counts as in-scope for a security review,
2. how findings are reported,
3. how in-scope findings are rewarded.

## 1. Audit readiness

The repository holds the artifacts a third-party auditor needs, so a review
starts from buildable, pinned, reproducible inputs:

* **Pinned toolchain and target** — `rust-toolchain.toml` pins Rust `1.97.1`
  and the `wasm32v1-none` WASM target; the contract refuses to build for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` or with debug assertions (`lib.rs` guards).
* **Reproducible build** — `script/release.sh` and `script/provenance.sh`
  produce and verify a SLSA-style wasm manifest (`docs/provenance.md`).
* **Interface of record** — `docs/ABI.md` and `contracts/stream/abi/fluxora_stream.json`
  pin the public ABI; `docs/audit.md` is the drift-checked entrypoint table.
* **Invariant suite** — the 36 test modules (≈570 tests) assert the I1–I5
  invariants after every operation, over random schedules (`test::props`) and
  across every entry-point ordering (`test::monotonicity`).
* **Known-limits register** — `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md` records what a green
  suite does *not* prove. Reviewers are asked to read it before anything else.

**Status:** no third-party audit has been completed. Do not claim otherwise.
This document lowers the cost of the first one.

## 2. Audit scope

### In scope

* `contracts/stream/` — the entire contract: `src/accrual.rs` (arithmetic),
  `src/lib.rs` (all entry points), `src/storage.rs` (TTL and storage access),
  `src/types.rs`, `src/error.rs`, `src/events.rs`.
* Fund-safety properties: the I1–I5 invariants in `contracts/stream/src/accrual.rs`
  and the pool invariant `liability <= contract balance`.
* The off-chain math mirror `sdk/stream-math.js` (must never disagree with
  `accrual.rs`).
* Build/provenance tooling in `script/` and `tools/provenance/` (only insofar
  as a defect could ship a wrong wasm).

### Out of scope

* `contracts/factory/`, `contracts/governance/` — separate products for their
  own review.
* `contracts/archival-probe/` — a throwaway probe, never deployed as product.
* Deploy/infra configuration, key custody, and any frontend.
* Known limits already disclosed in `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`.

### Readiness gate — what the out-of-scope reviewers must accept

A reviewer accepts this scope by confirming:

1. the release build reproduces byte-for-byte from a fresh checkout
   (`script/release-dry-run.sh`), and
2. the invariant suite passes at the pinned toolchain, and
3. ambition of the ABI snapshot (`docs/audit.md`) matches `src/lib.rs`.

## 3. Reporting

* **Private:** email the maintainers (addresses in the GitHub org). Include
  reproduction, expected vs actual, and impact.
* **On-chain:** an exploit attempt that provably drains or locks funds is
  disclosed privately first; there is no public-fine process that worries about
  front-running.
* **Public:** anything that is not a fund-safety issue (UI, docs, gas) can be
  filed straight as a GitHub issue.

Every report is acknowledged within 7 days and answered with a fix plan or a
reasoned non-issue within 30.

## 4. Bug bounty

* **Severity scale** — Critical (guards broken, funds at risk), High
  (funds stuck or commutative accounting corruption), Medium (invariant
  violation without fund loss), Low (gas, UX, informational) — aligned with the
  settlement model below.
* **Rewards** — reserved for a campaign the maintainers open before mainnet
  launch; the amounts and token denom are set in that announcement. Until then
  this section is a contract, not a funded pool:
  * Critical — top reward tier, awarded at the discretion of the maintainers
    after a verified impact.
  * High/Medium — tiered, only in an open campaign.
  * Low/informational — acknowledgements in `docs/accredited.md` once created.
* **Eligibility** — any original finding; excluded are findings already
  disclosed in `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`, `docs/audit.md`, this file, or
  developer-found during a scheduled audit. Self-research against the deployed
  testnet contract is fine; a live mainnet exploit attempt to *demonstrate* a
  bounty finding is not eligible and is a crime on most chains.
* **Disclosure** — bounty-worthy findings are disclosed after a fix ships or
  the maintainers grant a 90-day embargo.
